## GymTracker

GymTracker is an app with a purpose to help us develop our body, by providing monitoring capabilities of our physical growth and training progress. 
It does it by focusing on separate muscles, endurance and other body qualities represented by **functions**. Evetything that you need to do is to put your training data: exercise type, number of reps, weight etc. The program will automatically calculate the **development level** of your body based on the data and will display your progress as a line chart

The exact body function, exercises and their relation to the functions are supposed to be filled by admin and moderators
